Description: This is a project to create an animated painting using the esp32, a servo motor, and a step motor.

Materials:
-esp32
-servo motor
-step motor

Hardware: 
  Servo- 
    connect the servo motor to the driver with the blue wire in line with the first light of the driver
    connnect the driver to the esp32 by connecting IN1 to GPIO 14 IN2 to GPIO 27 IN3 to GPIO 26 and IN4 to GPIO 25
    Connect power to power and ground to ground
  Step-
    Connect the yellow wire to GPIO 15
    Connect the orage wire to 5v
    Connect the brown wire to ground
    
How To:

1. Paint something you want to animate
3. Wire your esp32 as stated above
4. Determine where you want to place your motors on the painting and cut out small holes for them.
5. Attatch popsicle sticks using hot glue to the mototrs and attached the creatures you want to animate to the posicle sticks.
6. Create a file and copy the python code
7. Upload the .ino code to the esp32 (if using the api replace my uni with yours)
8. Power on the esp 32 then run the python script.
9. Open your personal page http://165.227.76.232:3000/YOUR_UNI/ and press run!


Enclosure: 
I taped the painting to a painted piece of cardboard to make it more sturdy. I then used a hammer and nail to mark where I wanted the motors to stick through from the back of the painting. I used tape and hot glue to secure popsicle sticks on top of the rotating motors and then secured the paintings of the creatures to the popsicle sticks!
